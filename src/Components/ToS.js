        <p>
            This website ('we', 'us' 'our') stores your name and lunch order information on our backend.
            This information is shared with organisers so they can help you with your lunch order.

            When you link a login service, you allow us to access information from the
            login service provider ('SSO') that uniquely identifies you to our backend.
            This information is stored and used to authenticate you when logging in.
        </p>

            When linking login services, please use SSO accounts that only you control and have access to.
